# TimeSeriesAnalysis

For this we're using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) concerning Electricity and Gas Utilities Production from January 1992 to January 2019 (325 records).

Data source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IPG2211A2N

We'll do the following:
* Perform standard imports, load & plot the dataset (code provided)
* Prepare data for an LSTM model
* Define the LSTM model, loss and optimization functions
* Train the model
* Evaluate the model on test data
